class="c19" id="h.b1eag0axuri7"><span class="c31 c9">Introduction</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The foundational monomers and building blocks of our DNA-based hydrogel are linearized plasmids containing the gene of interest and X-DNA units. The linearized plasmid serves as the template for protein expression. The plasmid was linearized to facilitate ligation into the hydrogel and enhanced accessibility for transcriptional machinery. Following linearization, the plasmid was dephosphorylated to prevent self-ligation. When needed, it was rephosphorylated to restore 5&rsquo; phosphate groups for compatibility with crosslinking. X-DNA is a synthetic DNA nanostructure composed of four single-stranded oligonucleotides that hybridize into a four-way junction due to the complementarity of their sequences. These junctions act as structural nodes that interconnect plasmid molecules through sequence-specific base pairing. As a result, a mechanically stable and transcriptionally active gel network was formed, capable of supporting cell-free protein expression within a confined 3D matrix.</span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.7w6cwiy5w1ag"><span class="c9">Techniques</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">Restriction enzyme digestion</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Restriction digestion is a process that uses restriction endonucleases to cut DNA at specific sites. This was performed using XmaI, which cuts at a unique sequence within the plasmid encoding carbonic anhydrase. This converts the circular plasmid to a linear form, which is more suitable for incorporation into the DNA hydrogel (Park et al. 2009). A key reason for linearization is that it reduces the likelihood of unwanted topological effects, such as supercoiling, and makes hybridization with DNA crosslinkers more predictable. The reaction was carried out in the presence of a 10x restriction digestion buffer, which provided the optimal pH for enzyme activity. </span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">DNA purification</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">DNA purification was used to remove residual enzymes, salts, and buffer components after digestion. A silica column-based purification kit was used, which relied on the selective affinity of DNA for silica under high-salt, chaotropic conditions. This selectivity arises because chaotropic agents such as guanidinium salts disrupt the hydrogen bonding in water, causing nucleic acids to become dehydrated and exposing their phosphate backbones. These negatively charged backbones formed electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface, enabling the DNA to bind tightly to the filter membrane (Vandeventer et al., 2013). In contrast, proteins and other contaminants either lack sufficient negative charge or are denatured by the chaotropic salts, preventing them from binding efficiently and allowing them to be washed away (Promega, 2025). Once contaminants were removed, the bound DNA was eluted in nuclease-free water, which lowers the salt concentration and disrupts the DNA-silica interaction, thereby releasing the DNA into solution. This step ensured that the plasmid used for downstream annealing and gel formation was clean and free of inhibitory impurities that could affect later analysis.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">Gel electrophoresis</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm both plasmid linearization and successful X-DNA formation. This technique separates DNA fragments based on size by applying an electric field to a gel matrix. DNA samples were loaded into wells of an agarose gel and submerged in 1x TAE running buffer, which provides the necessary ionic environment for current flow. When an electric field is applied, the negatively charged DNA migrates toward the positive electrode (anode). The agarose gel contains microscopic pores that act as a molecular sieve, allowing smaller DNA fragments to move more quickly through the matrix than larger ones (Lee et al., 2012). Linear DNA migrates differently from its circular or supercoiled counterparts, allowing confirmation of successful plasmid digestion through changes in band position. A DNA ladder (a molecular weight standard of known sizes) was used as a reference to assess fragment sizes, and shifts in migration patterns were analyzed to verify proper digestion and annealing. </span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">Thermal Annealing of Oligonucleotides</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">DNA annealing was used to assemble the X-DNA nanostructure from four single-stranded oligonucleotides (X1-X4). Annealing refers to the process of hybridization, where complementary strands of DNA bind through complementary base pairing. The oligos were mixed in a buffer and subjected to a thermocycling program that gradually reduced the temperature from 95&deg;C to 25&deg;C. This slow cooling facilitated the correct folding and pairing of the strands into a stable four-way junction, known as X-DNA. Such junctions serve as crosslinking elements capable of hybridizing with specific sequences on the linearized plasmid, allowing them to form a physically interconnected network. </span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">Buffer Exchange using Centrifugal Filtration</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Buffer exchange was performed using centrifugal ultrafiltration to purify and concentrate the annealed X-DNA, thereby preparing it for integration into the hydrogel. This technique allows the replacement of the solution surrounding a biomolecule with a more suitable buffer, which is essential when transitioning between experimental conditions. A centrifugal filter unit with a 3,000 Da molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) was used. During high-speed centrifugation, small molecules, such as excess salts, unbound nucleotides, and annealing buffer components, passed through the membrane, while the larger X-DNA structures were retained. This process enabled simultaneous purification, buffer exchange, and concentration of X-DNA. Buffer exchange into nuclease-free water reduced ionic strength, enhancing compatibility with hydrogel formation and cell-free protein expression. Maintaining clean buffer conditions is crucial for reducing ionic strength, preserving structural integrity, and ensuring reproducibility in subsequent applications.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c3">Spectrophotometry (Nanodrop)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Spectrophotometry was used to quantify DNA concentration using absorbances at 260 nm. DNA maximally absorbs ultraviolet light at this wavelength due to its nucleotide bases, and an absorbance of 1.0 corresponds to 50&micro;g/mL of double-stranded DNA in a standard 1 cm path length. Using this ratio, the concentration of DNA in a sample can be deduced based on the absorbance of the sample. This quantification step ensures that we use standardized DNA concentrations during hydrogel formation, which affects both mechanical strength and expression yield, and allows for reproducibility in our results (Qiagen, n.d.).</span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.h8pkpe35k3p7"><span class="c9">Reagents</span></h1><table class="c33"><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reagent Name</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Supplier</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Catalogue Number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">10X CutSmart Buffer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">New England Biolabs</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">B6004S</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Restriction Enzyme XmaI</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">New England Biolabs</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">R0180S</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Nuclease-free water</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hallam Lab</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">NA</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Agarose</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sigma-Aldrich</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c24">A9539</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">1X TAE Buffer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hallam Lab</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">NA</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c41"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">SYBR Safe</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ThermoFisher</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c47">S33102</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">5X DNA loading dye</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ThermoFisher</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c47">R0611</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">QIAquick Miniprep Kit</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Qiagen</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">27104</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Oligonucleotides</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">IDT</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c24">&mdash; </span><span class="c9 c11">Custom Order</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">1X TE buffer (pH 8.0)</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hallam Lab</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span></p></td></tr></table><h1 class="c19" id="h.inziny420ijo"><span class="c31 c9">Methods</span></h1><p class="c51"><span class="c9 c24">This protocol was adapted from Park et al.

This process involved three critical steps. First, a gel precursor solution consisting of X-DNA, plasmid, ligase, and buffer was formed. &nbsp;Next, the precursor solution was placed on a glass slide and incubated, allowing for the gel to form (using DNA ligase to covalently crosslink the X-DNA and linearized plasmid components). Lastly, the P-gel pads were carefully detached from the PDMS and stored in 1x TAE buffer. Overall, this protocol took approximately 4 hours, and the steps were performed in parallel to produce multiple p-gels simultaneously (Park et al., 2009). </span></p><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.5dxkr2ruv2p7"><span class="c31 c9">Techniques</span></h1><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Cross-Linking &amp; DNA Ligation</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">DNA ligation is the process of covalently linking DNA strands by forming a phosphodiester bond between a 3&prime;-OH and a 5&prime;-phosphate in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by DNA ligase (Park et al., 2009). In our X-DNA hydrogel, monomers first assemble by sticky-end hybridization to create a temporary and weak DNA network of nicked X-DNA and linearized plasmid junctions. Ligation then seals these nicks, converting the annealed sticky ends into continuous backbones and locking the X-DNA and plasmid network into a covalently crosslinked gel. This step increases the hydrogel&rsquo;s stability and prevents dissociation under dilution.

In this protocol, it was used to confirm that the P-gel formed a continuous, interconnected network. To visualize DNA using confocal microscopy, intercalating fluorescent SYBR Green dyes were used. These dyes insert between the base pairs of double-stranded DNA and emit bright fluorescence when excited by a laser, effectively tracing the distribution and density of DNA strands throughout the gel. By scanning across the z-axis, the confocal microscope produced layered optical sections that revealed uniform fluorescence and a stable crosslinked matrix, validating successful hydrogel formation (Park et al., 2009).</span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.2af76zbnnmdq"><span class="c9">Reagents</span></h1><table class="c33"><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reagent Name</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Supplier</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Catalogue Number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">T4 DNA Ligase</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">New England Biolabs</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">M0202S</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">10X T4 Ligase Buffer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">New England Biolabs</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">B0202S </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c26">Xmal</span><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;sticky ends X-DNA Oligomers</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c16">&mdash;</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c9">&mdash;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">100 nM Linearized Plasmid</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c9">&mdash;</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c9">&mdash;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Nuclease-Free Water</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c9">&mdash;</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c9">&mdash;</span></p></td></tr></table><h1 class="c19" id="h.ale7wtyao0y"><span class="c31 c9">Methods</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c2">To produce the P-gel pads, a P-gel precursor solution was prepared consisting of X-DNA stock solution, linearized plasmid solution, T4 DNA ligase, 10x DNA ligase buffer, and nuclease-free water (Park et al., 2009).

Since most protein synthesis occurs at the gel&rsquo;s surface, increasing surface area is expected to enhance overall reaction yield. To align with these findings, our team designed PDMS molds to shape the hydrogel prior to cross-linking. Both the mold composition and geometry were critical design parameters and discussed in the design page of the website.</span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.mmkymgnalygv"><span class="c31 c9">Techniques</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c14 c3">Resin Negative Mold</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">A resin negative mold was fabricated to serve as the master template for PDMS casting. The term &lsquo;negative&rsquo; refers to the fact that the mold&rsquo;s geometry is the inverse of the desired final structure, where raised regions in the resin correspond to channels or cavities in the resulting PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) mold. This ensures that when PDMS is poured and cured over the resin surface, it forms a positive replica with features matching the intended design. These molds must be produced by 3D printing a high-resolution resin pattern, which is then post-cured under UV light to enhance hardness and surface fidelity. The cured resin master is cleaned with isopropanol to remove uncured residues and fully dried before PDMS casting, ensuring accurate feature transfer and easy demolding.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">PDMS Positive Mold</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">A PDMS mold was cast from the resin negative to shape the P-Gels into the correct geometry.

The liquid PDMS was then poured over the resin negative mold, ensuring complete coverage of all surface features, and cured at 60 &deg;C for several hours until fully cross-linked. Once cured, the PDMS layer was carefully peeled off the resin master, yielding a soft, durable mold with feature dimensions identical to the original design. The resulting PDMS mold could then be used as a flexible template for subsequent hydrogel or microfluidic casting steps.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.truzd5j7dnef"><span class="c9">Reagents</span></h1><table class="c33"><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reagent Name</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Supplier</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Catalogue Number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit </span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Dow Corning</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c49"><span class="c4">W292907</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Isopropanol (IPA)</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sigma-Aldrich</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I9516</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Petri Dish</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Thermo Fisher Scientific</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c17 c3">&mdash;</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.o2leos8kl6mk"><span class="c31 c9">Methods</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c14 c3">Resin Negative Mold</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The negative mold was fabricated using a Formlabs Form 3+ stereolithography (SLA) printer with Formlabs Clear Resin v4.

The addition of an antibiotic to LB agar medium allows for the selection of only bacteria that are resistant to that antibiotic, which can be conferred by a plasmid carrying the antibiotic resistance gene (Addgene, 2016).

The tag was designed to be located on the C terminus of the protein.

Protein tags can be used to prevent the need for consecutive columns during purification, while still achieving high purity. Proteins are typically tagged on either the N or C terminus to prevent interference with their folding structure and function. Protein tags can also be either cleavable or non-cleavable, adding to their versatility. Generally, the tag will have a high affinity for ligands that can be immobilized on the column, while molecules with lower affinity for the column, such as non-target proteins still present from cell lysis, will flow through the column. One pitfall is that tags can sometimes interfere with the protein structure or function; in these instances, they must be cleaved. To do this, a cleavage recognition sequence can be added between the protein and the tag, allowing a protease to cleave the tag from the protein at this position. </span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.3kq94ojz4gpj"><span class="c9">Reagents: Protein Isolation</span></h1><table class="c33"><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reagent Name</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Supplier</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Catalogue Number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Ni-His Spin Column</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Elution Buffer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Wash Buffer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Equilibrium Buffer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ThermoFischer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">88224</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.18r5cr7i258x"><span class="c31 c9">Methods: Protein Isolation</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c9">To compare the isolation of the cell-free protein system to a cell-based protein system, a positive control was performed using an </span><span class="c9 c15">Escherichia coli</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;(E.coli) based expression system.

This included 2 controls and 3 experimental conditions. For controls, a dilute flow-through fraction lacking detectable protein served as the negative control, while a positive control containing a known quantity of CA provided a reference for signal calibration. Two cell-free protein production (CFPP) systems were evaluated: a P-gel-based CFPP using a crosslinked DNA hydrogel matrix as its template scaffold, and a plasmid-based CFPP relying on free plasmid templates in solution. Finally, cell-based production using </span><span class="c9 c15">E. coli</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;isolates served as the benchmark for conventional CA expression and purification.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">All samples were first quantified for total protein content using a BCA assay (Figure 7). Raw absorbance measurements showed a strong response in the positive control and minimal signal in the negative control. All experimental conditions contained significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more protein than the negative control and significantly less than the positive control. Upon conversion of absorbance values to concentration, all experimental groups yielded approximately 100 &micro;g/mL of protein. Because these readings were taken after nickel affinity purification and buffer exchange by size exclusion spin column, the measured protein most likely corresponds to carbonic anhydrase. No significant differences were observed among the experimental conditions for raw absorbance data.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 281.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/exp/image9.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 281.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Figure 7: Raw absorbance values of BCA assay (left) and calculated concentrations (&micro;g/ml) from standard curve (right).</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">An SDS-PAGE gel was run for all experimental conditions described above. The positive control displayed a distinct band at 30 kD, whereas the negative control showed no detectable band, confirming that the gel and staining procedure functioned properly. None of the experimental samples exhibited visible bands, likely due to insufficient protein loaded into the gel or non-optimized experimental conditions. Notably, the 5X diluted positive control produced a faint band; given that the original sample contained approximately 1500 &micro;g/mL protein, this dilution corresponds to ~300 &micro;g/mL, roughly threefold higher than the experimental samples. Thus, the absence of visible bands in the experimental lanes is consistent with the expected lower protein concentrations despite the confirmed presence of protein via BCA. As well, the absence of bands in the expected lanes could indicate a need for further experimentation to optimize sample preparation and loading conditions of the SDS-PAGE.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 366.55px; height: 304.87px;"><img alt="" src="images/exp/image12.png" style="width: 366.55px; height: 304.87px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">Figure 8:</span><span class="c9 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">Lanes </span><span class="c3">A</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">B</span><span class="c9">: ladder; Lane </span><span class="c3">C</span><span class="c9">: positive control; Lane </span><span class="c3">D</span><span class="c9">: negative control; Lanes </span><span class="c3">E</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">F</span><span class="c9">: E. coli flow-through; Lane </span><span class="c3">G</span><span class="c9">: P-Gel; Lane </span><span class="c3">H</span><span class="c9">: plasmid-only cell-free protein production; Lanes </span><span class="c3">I</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">J</span><span class="c9">: flow-through from P-Gel and plasmid-only samples; Lanes </span><span class="c3">K</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">L</span><span class="c9">: 5&times; dilutions of the positive and negative controls; Lanes </span><span class="c3">M</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">N</span><span class="c9">: 5&times; dilutions of the P-Gel and plasmid-only samples; Lane </span><span class="c3">O</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.vs1q3d7xoss1"><span class="c31 c9">Carbonic Anhydrase Activity Assay</span></h1><h2 class="c25 c22" id="h.jsi4mr3jhaww"><span class="c30 c9">Abbreviations Used</span></h2><ul class="c27 lst-kix_d1go8u71kpqj-0 start"><li class="c5 c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">CA: Carbonic Anhydrase</span></li><li class="c5 c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">BC: Background control</span></li><li class="c5 c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">S: Sample</span></li><li class="c5 c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">NC: Negative Control</span></li><li class="c5 c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">PC: Positive Control</span></li></ul><h1 class="c19" id="h.zi2snifetu0s"><span class="c31 c9">Introduction</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c9">The aim of this protocol is to determine if the purified sample contains functional carbonic anhydrase (CA) and to quantify its activity. After isolating CA from the P-Gel, an assay was needed to verify whether the extracted enzyme was functionally active. This required assessing the isolated protein&rsquo;s catalytic capability via a CA representative reaction. CA possesses two major catalytic activities: the hydration of carbon dioxide and the hydrolysis of ester bonds </span><span class="c9 c24">(Uda et al., 2015)</span><span class="c9">. Both reactions occur at the same active site, meaning that its esterase activity, which is easier to quantify, can serve as a reliable proxy for the enzyme&rsquo;s physiological carbon-fixation activity. Hence, the functionality of the isolated CA was evaluated using a colorimetric esterase assay to quantify the enzymatic activity of the isolated protein sample </span><span class="c9 c24">(Snoeck et al., 2024)</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">The activity assay works based on the hydrolysis of an ester substrate by CA, generating a product whose absorbance can be quantified spectrophotometrically.

In alkaline solutions, </span><span class="c9 c15">p</span><span class="c2">-nitrophenol becomes bright yellow and exhibits strong absorbance at 405 nm.

Zinc ions form the active center of carbonic anhydrase, coordinating a hydroxide ion that enables CO&#8322; hydration. Size-exclusion columns were used to replace the original solution and salts with the zinc buffer, retaining the enzyme while removing small molecules. This ensured proper metal reconstitution and preservation of maximal catalytic activity.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Colorimetric Activity Assay</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Colorimetric detection was used to quantify CA activity through spectrophotometric measurements of a chromogenic nitrophenol reaction product. This technique relies on establishing a standard curve by reacting known concentrations of purified CA with an ester substrate that yields a colored product upon hydrolysis. The absorbance of this product is measured at a specific wavelength (405 nm) using a spectrophotometer, generating a calibration curve that relates absorbance to enzymatic activity. The same procedure is then applied to the extracted CA samples, and their absorbance values are compared to the standard curve to determine activity. Agreement between the measured and expected responses confirms that the extracted enzyme is functionally active and consistent with carbonic anhydrase standards.</span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.cf5eykjcczlu"><span class="c9">Reagents</span></h1><table class="c33"><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reagent Name</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Supplier</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Catalogue Number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">CA Assay Buffer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">CA Enzyme I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">CA Inhibitor I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">CA Substrate (ester substrate)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Dilution Buffer VI</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Nitrophenol Standard</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Abcam</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">AB284550</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Microplate (96 well)</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ThermoFischer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c24"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/165305&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1760088291260741&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eQMANr9dsuppc5WfbQ6ZZ">165305</a></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Microplate Reader</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ThermoFischer</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c4">VL0000D0</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.laaf4pj3jepy"><span class="c31 c9">Methods</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Based on the results of the BCA assay, all samples showed no significant difference in total protein content yield from each condition.

As shown in Figure 9, both CFPP systems had similar activity readings with no significant difference observed. In contrast, the </span><span class="c9 c15">E. coli </span><span class="c9">cell-based expression method showed markedly lower activity, indicating that the CFPP-generated enzyme retained higher catalytic functionality. Importantly, because protein concentrations were considered normalized across all samples following BCA quantification and dilution to a common protein concentration, these activity differences are likely not attributable to differences in protein amount. Rather, they likely reflect true variations in enzyme quality and folding efficiency. This suggests that cell-free environments provide a more favourable context for maintaining enzyme conformation and activity compared to traditional cell-based production. This is likely due to the absence of intracellular stress responses, as carbonic anhydrase has been shown to potentially be toxic to </span><span class="c9 c15">E.
