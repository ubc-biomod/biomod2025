# **ELSI**

The UBC BIOMOD 2025 project entails the novel application of the DNA hydrogel-based protein synthesis system, previously developed by Park et al. (2009), in an E. coli lysate cell-free system. The system facilitates adaptable, scalable, and rapid protein expression using gene-encoded DNA hydrogels ("P-gels"). While this technology promises important advances in high-throughput protein production for therapeutic and research purposes, it also opens the door to a host of important ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) that must be considered at the local, national, and international levels. We recognized 5 general groups that may be affected (researchers, manufacturers, government/businesses, the general public and Indigenous peoples).

| Where | Who | Concerns (Title) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Research Facilities | Researchers | Ethical Protein Production and Application |
| **Concerns** |  |  |
| Given the flexibility of the DNA hydrogel, genes within the plasmid can easily be swapped out for those that encode for proteins other than carbonic anhydrase. While this replaceability makes the hydrogel an excellent high-yield alternative to bacterial protein production with a variety of applications, we must also keep in mind that there is little to no regulation regarding what gene is being inserted and what is being produced after someone purchases the hydrogel system for their own use. This leads to further concerns about the use of said technology. Lower barriers to protein production means that products like toxin proteins are easier to make in high numbers, which can potentially lead to the development of biological weapons like botulinum neurotoxin (Berger et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is no guaranteed protein purification nor post-translational modifications (PTMs) because the enzymes in a eukaryotic cell that would usually perform those processes are missing in the cell-free hydrogel system. This means that ethical concerns crop up in the use of proteins if they haven’t been properly processed or tested. Administration of proteins with abnormal PTMs results in loss or change in protein function and thus the development of disease (Zhong et al., 2023). |  |  |
| **Potential responses from non-researchers** |  |  |
| Can lead to the production of harmful proteins and/or biological weapons that pose a threat to public safety, which can incite a deep mistrust in the use of the product. A lack of quality control with what is being produced would also result in a loss of trust from non-researchers and an unwillingness to use the hydrogel or any proteins that it creates. The UN Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological agents and toxins with no peaceful or protective justification (Gerstein & Giordano, 2017). Implementation and policies are left up to individual countries, and Canada in particular has many regulations regarding biosafety, biosecurity, and transfer of substances (*UNIDIR*, n.d.). Ensuring that the hydrogel abides by these guidelines in production and distribution can help mitigate risks. Ensuring proper regulations regarding safe and ethical testing, as well as obtaining informed consent in clinical spheres, is also important in minimizing risks associated with the distribution and use of abnormal/non-functioning proteins. |  |  |

| Where | Who | Concerns (Title) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Government | Manufacturers | Waste Disposal and Scalability |
| **Concerns** |  |  |
| The manufacturing process deals largely with biological materials including cell lysates, plasmids, and DNA hydrogels. Thus, it falls on the manufacturer to ensure legal, ethical, and environmentally conscious disposal of wastes. While DNA is mostly biodegradable, recombinant DNA in the form of plasmids and lysates that contain various cell machinery may have more adverse effects on the earth. Manufacturers must abide by biohazardous waste disposal guidelines, which may differ slightly by region. This ensures that all products are chemically or enzymatically deactivated/neutralized and autoclaved before safe disposal (UBC, 2020). In the long-term, with massive scaling up of production, abiding by regulations to minimize risks associated with disposal will be incredibly important in maintaining a healthy environment and both for the earth and the people working. |  |  |
| **Potential responses from…** |  |  |
| Failing to abide by safe manufacturing and disposal guidelines can result in water contamination, soil degradation, and bioaccumulation (SAMSUNG E\&A, 2023\) to varying levels depending on the PTMs or other functional additives required for the production of a specific protein. Not only can this result in legal punishment in the form of fines up to $200 000 or imprisonment up to 6 months (*Environmental Management Act*, 2022), but it can also result in a loss of reputation and therefore a loss of worker and client base. |  |  |

| Government | Businesses | Intellectual Property Barriers in DNA Hydrogel Innovation |
| **Concerns** |  |  |
| The rapid growth of hydrogel technologies has led to a surge in patent filings, creating legal challenges for businesses trying to commercialize DNA hydrogel-based protein delivery. As of  2024, over 96,000 hydrogel-related patent documents had been filed worldwide, mainly in the United States and China (Fatimi et al., 2025). Many of these patents fall under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, reflecting an active push for international IP protection. DNA hydrogels often build on common material platforms like PEG, alginate, and chitosan, leading to overlapping claims or disputes over novelty. Businesses must navigate patent thickets – dense webs of overlapping patents on small variations of hydrogel formulations or methods. These increase legal costs and delay product launches. Small companies are especially affected due to high legal fees to ensure their product doesn’t infringe on multiple existing patents. A single hydrogel-based product might involve components owned by different parties, triggering complex licensing or disputes. These legal uncertainties can discourage businesses from pursuing hydrogel-based innovation together, limiting collaboration, slowing therapeutic development, and leaving useful technologies unexploited. Without a careful IP strategy, commercialization could be delayed, prices could rise due to licensing costs, and access could be restricted. |  |  |
| **Potential responses from…** |  |  |
| Encourage the use of open-source licensing models or patent pools for foundational hydrogel technologies. Governments can support startups by subsidizing patent searches and filings, and by creating IP frameworks that balance innovation with public accessibility. International collaboration on IP standards could reduce redundancy and prevent anti-competitive practices. |  |  |

| Home & Society | General Public | Unequal Access to Hydrogel-Based Treatments/ Technology |
| **Concerns** |  |  |
| If DNA hydrogel-based systems for therapeutic protein delivery become publicly available, access may be limited by high costs, distribution challenges and geographic disparities. Commercialization often involves proprietary licensing, regulatory overhead, and supply chain mark-ups. As seen in traditional pharmaceutical markets, distributor and retailer margins can drive retail prices far beyond production costs, and similar pricing dynamics could occur with hydrogel-based therapies (Lee et al., 2020). These factors make treatments unaffordable for low-income individuals and under-resourced health systems. Geographic limitations further threaten equitable access. In rural and remote regions, limited infrastructure, high transportation costs, and reduced healthcare coverage can delay the deployment of treatments. If hydrogel therapies require technical instructions, pharmacy-mediated delivery, or monitoring by trained personnel, patients in low-resource areas may face additional barriers. Companies may deprioritize these regions due to lower profit margins, limiting distribution outside urban centers (Lee et al., 2020). Exclusive patents on hydrogel components may restrict local or nonprofit manufacturing. This reduces transparency, increases dependence on single-source suppliers, and makes the technology harder to scale in underserved regions (Lee et al., 2020). Without equity-focused policies, hydrogel-based therapies risk excluding marginalized populations already underserved by healthcare systems. Socioeconomic barriers such as high out-of-pocket costs, limited health literacy, and poor infrastructure can prevent access, particularly in low-income or rural communities (Lee et al., 2020). |  |  |
| **Potential responses from…** |  |  |
| To keep hydrogel-based therapies affordable, governments could work with international health organizations (e.g., WHO, Medicines Patent Pool) and national health ministries to set limits on price mark-ups and remove taxes for treatments. A hydrogel access and pricing committee of government, researchers, patient advocates, and industry could oversee fair pricing and distribution. Improving delivery to rural and remote communities is also important. Regional hospitals, community clinics, and pharmacies could serve as local pick-up points, with courier or mobile health services delivering to patients’ homes when needed. Public-private partnerships and targeted subsidies should ensure hydrogel therapies remain affordable and widely available.  |  |  |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Rural Hospitals  | Indigenous People, communities, and health advocates  | Indigenous land rights and environmental ethics |
| **Concerns** |  |  |
| Many Indigenous communities have faced exclusion or harm from biomedical innovation. To maintain a high standard of ethical research and to respect both individual and collective consent, we can involve these communities early on in conversations about new technologies like P-gel-based protein therapies – as recommended by Fitzpatrick et. al. (2016). These conversations could include education on how hydrogel-based therapies are used, what materials are involved and what their purposes are, how reagents are sourced, and more. Especially if these are trialled or deployed in rural or Indigenous-serving hospitals, respect for data sovereignty when Indigenous biological samples are involved is a key ethical priority. We could also work with government or local bodies to help train members of Indigenous communities to be directly involved in the manufacturing, distribution, and use of the hydrogels so that they have autonomy and first-hand knowledge concerning the technology. As well, if any production or distribution occurs or passes through Indigenous lands, we will ensure proper permissions are received from the involved groups.  |  |  |
| **Potential responses from…** |  |  |
| Indigenous governance bodies may respond by calling for community-specific consultation frameworks, co-developed ethics protocols, and bioethical review processes that are culturally informed and sensitive to the needs of Indigenous peoples. |  |  |
